# Simple Accounting

This is a simple finance tracking application that I build during my Ruby on Rails bootcamp at Techrise. Using this app you can track all financial activities going on in your life. You can see your balance, debt and total money. You can add new records. You can also edit or delete them. Lets make a good use of this app. :)
